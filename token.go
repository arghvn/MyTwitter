//  what is the Token in programming ?

//  A token is a piece of hardware or software used to log users into computer services.
//  Security tokens are used to prove the identity of each person.
//  A token is generally defined as very small pieces of hardware used to log in to a computer service.
//  Security tokens are used electronically for security measures such as customer authentication,
// which is an electronic key to access the system.
//  Some other tokens use digital signatures to identify a person's biometric information, such as a fingerprint.
//  In general, a token is something that indicates something else; Like another object (whether physical or virtual).
//   For example, a gift is sometimes used as a Token or as a sign that the giver values ​​the recipient.

//  There are several types of tokens in computers:
//  1. In a token ring network, the presence of a token (which is only a specific bit setting) in a
//continuously rotating transmission stream allows a device to change the bit setting (thus receiving the token)
//and a Put the message in its place. The recipient of the message receives the message elsewhere on the token loop network,
// then deletes it and resets the bit (thus retrieves the token) so that someone else in the device
//loop can use that message space in turn  Have.
//  2. The programming token is the main component of the source code.
//Characters are categorized as one of five classes of tokens that describe their
//functions (constants, identifiers, operators, reserved words, and delimiters) according to the rules of the programming language.
//  3. A security token is a physical device, such as a special smart card, that,
// along with something the user knows, such as a PIN, allows authorized access to a computer system or network.

//  The role of tokens in computer security:
//  In terms of computer security, a "token" is a type of encrypted data in which a string of generated
// algorithmic data acts as an alternative to the original data. This prevents even encrypted
//messages from sending real data over the Internet. This means that the token is related to real data but does not contain real data.
//Many digital payment systems and other types of digital systems use these types of tokens.

//  What is Security Token in Computer?
//  If we want to answer the question what is a Token,
// we must say that today tokens are used by users instead of using a normal password to log in to the system.
// Some tokens are encrypted keys that store digital or biometric information such as fingerprints.
